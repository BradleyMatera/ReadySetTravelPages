# Project & Portfolio: Travel Site

## Workflow and Version Control Standards and Expectations

**This GitHub repository serves as a foundational pillar for my journey forward. It meticulously outlines my workflow, details the version control practices I adhere to, and exemplifies how I initiate and sustain a project from its inception through continuous updates and maintenance. Utilizing a combination of GitHub, VS Code, and the Mac terminal, this repository not only demonstrates my project development process but also my commitment to employing industry-standard version control methodologies to ensure efficient and scalable project evolution.**

### Week 2

**⚙️ Overview - What I worked on this past week:**

- Completed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the ReadySetTravel homepage
- Implemented responsive grid layout for the Destinations section
- Added smooth scrolling functionality for navigation links
- Implemented interaction for the Book Now buttons
- Added form submission handling
- Aligned CSS selectors with the HTML structure
- Avoided overly specific or presentational styles
- Adjusted the height of the hero section to match the design mockup

- Ensured a consistent workflow by making regular commits spread over multiple days

**🌵 Challenges - What problems did I have & how I'm addressing them:**

- Faced challenges in aligning the CSS selectors with the HTML structure initially. Addressed this by carefully reviewing the HTML structure and making necessary adjustments to the CSS selectors to ensure a perfect alignment.
- Encountered issues with implementing responsive grid layout for the Destinations section. Overcame this by using CSS media queries and testing the layout on different screen sizes to ensure proper responsiveness.
- Had difficulties in achieving smooth scrolling functionality for navigation links. Resolved this by using JavaScript to listen for click events on the navigation links and smoothly scrolling to the corresponding section using the `scrollIntoView` method.

**🏆 Accomplishments - What is something I "leveled up" on this week:**

- Improved my understanding of CSS selectors and how to align them with the HTML structure for better code organization and maintainability.
- Enhanced my skills in implementing responsive layouts using CSS grid and media queries, ensuring that the website adapts well to different screen sizes.

- Deepened my knowledge of accessibility best practices and learned how to incorporate them into the website, making it more inclusive for all users.

**🔮 Next Steps - What I plan to prioritize and do next:**

- Conduct thorough testing of the website on various devices and browsers to ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.
- Perform additional accessibility audits and make necessary improvements to meet the highest accessibility standards.
- Optimize the website's performance by minimizing the file sizes of images and implementing lazy loading for faster page load times.
- Explore adding more interactive features and functionality to enhance the user experience, such as a search functionality or a booking system.
- Gather user feedback and conduct usability testing to identify areas for further improvement and iterate on the design and functionality based on the feedback received.
- Document the development process, including the challenges faced and solutions implemented, to facilitate future maintenance and updates.
- Prepare the website for deployment by setting up the necessary hosting environment and ensuring seamless integration with the backend services.
- Plan for future enhancements and features to be added to the website, creating a roadmap for ongoing development and improvement.
