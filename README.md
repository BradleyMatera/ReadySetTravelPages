# Workflow and Version Control Standards and Expectations

**This GitHub repository serves as a foundational pillar for my journey forward. It meticulously outlines my workflow, details the version control practices I adhere to, and exemplifies how I initiate and sustain a project from its inception through continuous updates and maintenance. Utilizing a combination of GitHub, VS Code, and the Mac terminal, this repository not only demonstrates my project development process but also my commitment to employing industry-standard version control methodologies to ensure efficient and scalable project evolution.**
